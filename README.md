# DNA Nucleotide Counter

This project is a simple Streamlit application designed to count the nucleotide composition of a DNA sequence. It's an introduction to using Streamlit for building interactive web applications with Python.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Simply input your DNA sequence, and the app will display the count of each nucleotide.
- **Visualizations**: The app provides a bar chart visualization of the nucleotide counts for a clear overview.
- **Input Validation**: The app ensures that the input contains only valid DNA nucleotides (A, T, G, C).

## Libraries Used

- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/): For creating the web application.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation.
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/): For data visualization.

2. Install the required libraries:
   \```
   pip install streamlit pandas altair
   \```
3. Clone this repository or download the `dna_app.py` file.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   \```
   streamlit run dna_app.py
   \```
5. Visit the local URL displayed in the terminal to interact with the app.
